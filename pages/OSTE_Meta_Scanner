## Overview
The OSTE Meta Scanner project aims to simplify the field of Dynamic Application Security Testing. it is a comprehensive web vulnerability scanner that combines multiple DAST scanners, including Nikto Scanner, OWASP ZAP, Nuclei, SkipFish, and Wapiti.

## Introduction 
This software offers a user-friendly graphical interface that presents a comprehensive report for each scan, making the scanning process effortless and straightforward.

The main focus of this scanner is on web injection vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS injection, OS command injection, XML injection, and many more. Additionally, it provides a list of vulnerabilities supported by each scanner, apart from injection vulnerabilities.

It offers two types of reports. The first is a consolidated report in JSON format, which includes important reports from each scanner. It contains details such as the vulnerability, the corresponding URL, the parameter used, the Curl command, the attack vector, a description of the vulnerability, and more.

The second report is an HTML file format that specifically highlights successful injection attacks. The scanner results and decisions are based on a novel learning algorithm proposed during the ("A Meta-Scan based approach for the detection of injection vulnerabilities in Web applications.", -University May 8, 1945 -Guelma -, Computer Science Department, Presented by: SEYYID TAQY EDINE OUDJANI, Supervised by: DR. ABDELHAKIM HANNOUSSE. 2023).
